# Initiatives

An _initiative_ is a collection of one or more milestones that, taken together, address one or more themes. Initiatives map to major projects that the Taskcluster team would like to accomplish, and can be either new functionality or substantial reworks of existing functionality. Depending on the project area, an initiative can be a thin wrapper around a single milestone if that milestone is high value and self-contained.

The following are the current initiatives:

* [Keep the Lights On](#ktlo)
* [Automation Needs](#automation-needs)
* [Initiate and drive Fenix release automation through the Shipit service](#fenix-shipit)
* [Apple Silicon Support](#apple-silicon-support)
* [Test Scheduling improvements](#test-scheduling)
* [Implement Android v3 signatures and sign Fenix with them](#fenix-v3-signatures)
* [Rotate releng secrets and share with the team](#secrets-rotation)
* [Integrate Geckoview and Android-Components in the Fenix pipeline on Shipit](#geckoview-android-components-shipit)
* [Reduce wasted compute and idle time in our CI infrastructure](#task-efficiencies)
* [ActiveData Maintenance](#activedata-maintenance)
* [Right-size cloud instances](#right-size-instances)
* [Balrog Metadata Submission](#balrog-metadata)
* [Push Health UX Rework](#push-health-ux-rework)
* [Automated MozillaVPN signing](#mozillavpn-signing)
* [Specific bug fixes and feature requests for sheriffs](#treeherder-sheriff-requests)
* [Finish Python 3 migration](#python-3-migration)
* [Push Health MozCI integration](#push-health-mozci)
* [Test distribution and scheduling optimizations](#test-distribution-optimization)
* [Developer Productivity](#developer-productivity)
* [archive.mozilla.org cleanup](#archive-cleanup)
* [Improve iOS build, release, and CI pipeline](#ios-needs)
