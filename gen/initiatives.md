# Initiatives

An _initiative_ is a collection of one or more milestones that, taken together, address one or more themes. Initiatives map to major projects that the Taskcluster team would like to accomplish, and can be either new functionality or substantial reworks of existing functionality. Depending on the project area, an initiative can be a thin wrapper around a single milestone if that milestone is high value and self-contained.

The following are the current initiatives:

* [Apple Silicon Support](#apple-silicon-Support)
* [Initiate and drive Fenix release automation through the Shipit service](#fenix-shipit)
* [Keep the Lights On](#ktlo)

To update this information, edit `data/initiatives.yml` and run `generate.py`.
