# Sprint retrospective - Cross-Training, November 30, 2020 - December 18, 2020

## Initial changes to consider for this sprint
- To start using JIRA Sprints and the story points system.
- To split epics into stories, discrete pieces of work, each with estimated number of human days: ~1 day = 1 story point. We also considered Fibonacci story points at some point, but delayed for a future iteration.
- To agree that Scrum Master and Product Owners catch-up during regular 1x1s.

## Marco meeting

During our review and retrospective, :mmucci, who has a long-time history and experience in leading Scrums, attended to help us with an opinion from outside the team and provide feedback.

He had several high value suggestions and a somewhat different Sprint model mechanics:
* In time, it gets better and sprint productivity comes with experience
* don't have estimates at all as Monte Carlo is used for forecasting
  - new project comes along, potential MVP
  - four weeks as normal, people assign tasks and get stuff done
  - Monte Carlo model is being fed the data and output the speed/velocity
  - every two weeks we update the forecast (to answer are we on track to finish, ahead/behind?)
  - people work as normal and that works for them
  - all the forecasting is done in the background (meet once a week)
* this model is an efficient method to prevent teams take more work than they can handle
* forecast helps with setting limits
* during planning session, Scrum Master sets the MVP e.g. 10 most important bugs, agreed in the team
* Monte Carlo system can also work with story points
  - story should not be measured in time. Time itself is the velocity there
  - possible solution: list of work. Set three buckets: easy, medium, hard. Compare them with each other. Itâ€™s not about absolute, but relative. Treat each bucket differently. The easy buckets can have 1-2-3. Randomly pick a bug (medium difficulty and set it to 2). Then compare it against all of the others and challenge. Medium ones are 5 - 8 - 13. Hard ones are 20 and try to break as much as possible. Repeat this every sprint and compare / challenge; it will get better over time.


## What worked
- Got a lot of stuff done in various different epics, having a good level of cross-training
- Planning worked well for some of the epics
- First steps towards tracking interruptduty, though not ideal, a good starting point
- We actually used a JIRA sprint board and got more familiarized with JIRA mechanics
- Started having sprint standups in a dedicated channel to save time and knowledge transfer between timezones
- Started using the story points model; though not fully functional, was a good starting point

## What didn't
- Unclear how to split story points into smaller granular tickets < 1 day to account for interrupts or smaller pieces of work
- Interruptduty was confusing as it wasn't clear what to track and what not
- Setting up priorities and depicting them in the spring board has not worked properly
- We need to be more mindful about timezone coverage when sprinting with co-workers

## Process changes for next sprint
- Have a dedicated channel for daily standup
- We should allocate good time for planning in order to be successful. We validated that for VPN, we should extend for all epics going forward
- Set clear number of story points == number of engineering days, rather than adding stuff and trim later.
- We should have the sprint, product owners and mechanics ready before the sprint starts.
- Good to have a back burner to default work to.
- Product owners can be the product owner of their epic(s), but scrum master of another epic
